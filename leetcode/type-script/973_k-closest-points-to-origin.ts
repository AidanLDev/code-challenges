/*
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

 

Example 1:


Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].

function kClosest(points: number[][], k: number): number[][] {
  const values: number[][] = Array(points.length);
  for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
    //  (1,3) -> 1^2+3^2 = 10;
    const [x, y] = points[i];
    const dist = x * x + y * y;
    values.push([dist, i]);
  }
  values.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  const res: number[][] = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    res.push(points[values[i][1]]);
  }
  return res;
}
